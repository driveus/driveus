//Things to be careful of:
//The loaders -- npm install null-loader otherwise Karma would keep looking for JSON to run the code
//Including plugins is important!
//As we start adding more testing files, lines 15 and 18 would change to 'tests.webpack.js'
//which basically loops through the test folder and tests each file with the extension -- ...test.js
